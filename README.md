Due to some technical problems, i had to update all the projects that were intitally created in individual repositorys into a single one. Since doing add* wouldnt detect any changes i was forced to make a small change and create a new branch with that content. 

So even if both branches share most of the files, they both have them uploaded, i could have created the projects again and update them properly but i didnt have the time since the deadline was close.
